# Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors calculator

Simple calculator for performing simple operations on matrices and calculating eigenvectors and eigenvalues by different methods. It works with matrices of range 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4.

### Operations:

* Matrix addition and substraction
* Matrix multiply by escalar
* Matrix transpose
* Product of matrices
* Determinant
* Eigenvalues
* Eigenvector and dominant eigenvalue (powers method)
* Eigenvectors and eigenvalues (Jacobi method)
